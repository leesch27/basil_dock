    "# Basil Docking V0.1 - Docking and Preliminary Analysis\n",
    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "__Target Audience__<br>\n",
    "Undergraduate chemistry/biochemistry students and, in general, people that have little to no knowledge of protein-ligand docking and would like to understand the general process of docking a ligand to a protein receptor.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Brief Overview__<br>\n",
    "Molecular docking is a computational method used to predict where molecules are able to bind to a protein receptor and what interactions exist between the molecule (from now on, refered to as \"ligand\") and the receptor. It is a popular technique utilized in drug discovery and design, as when creating new drugs and testing existing drugs aginst new receptors, it is useful to determine the likelihood of binding prior to screening as it can be used to eliminate molecules that are unlikely to bind to the receptor. This significantly reduces the potential cost and time needed to test the efficacy of a set of possible ligands. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The general steps to perform molecular docking, assuming the ligand and receptor are ready to be docked, include the generation of potential ligand binding poses and the scoring of each generated pose (which predicts how strongly the ligand binds to the receptor, with a more negative score corresponding to a stronger bond). To dock a ligand to a protein, both the receptor and the ligand/s need to be \"sanitized\"; which includes making sure bonds and protonation states are as they would be in an organism. The receptor and ligand/s also need to be converted into the correct file formats depending on which docking engine is utilized. With all of these steps needed for preparation alone, introducing a need for an in depth view for each distinct step. This series attempts to provide that, as well as give users flexibility to customize the proteins, ligands, and procedures used.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook series encompasses \n",
    "1. The preparation needed prior to docking (protein and ligand sanitation, ensuring files are in readable formats, and finding possible binding pockets)\n",
    "2. __The process of docking ligand/s to a protein receptor using two docking engines (VINA and SMINA) and visualizing/analyzing the outputs__\n",
    "3. Further data collection and manipulation\n",
    "\n",
    "__Stepwise summary for this notebook (docking and preliminary analysis, notebook 2 out of 3)__\n",
    "- Get docking box sizes from docking-prep notebook\n",
    "- Dock ligand to protein using either VINA or SMINA\n",
    "- Visualize different poses of ligands docked to protein\n",
    "- Visualize protein-ligand interactions of poses\n",

The amount of computational effort needed to generate the poses for a given pocket and ligand is called the exhaustiveness. As exhaustiveness increases, the more reproducible the results tend to be. While the default value of exhaustiveness is 8, this notebook uses an exhaustiveness of 5 due to memory limitations.\n",
    "- The results of running the VINA docking engine are stored as pdbqt files and can be located in the vina_out folder. In order to analyze and vizualize the results, the pdbqt files are converted into sdf files using the function pdbqt_to_sdf (created by Angel Ruiz-Moreno), which can be found in the vina_out_2 folder. The names of each file follows the formula of `(ligand name)_vina_pocket_(pocket number).pdbqt` for the pdbqt files and `(ligand name)_pocket_(pocket number)_(name of folder).sdf` for the sdf files."

    "- Using the the pdbqt file for the receptor, the mol2 file for the desired ligand, and the pocket center/size values from the prot_pockets dataframe, ligand poses are generated for each binding pocket (the number of poses depends on the value of num_modes, which is set to 5 in this notebook). The amount of computational effort needed to generate the poses for a given pocket and ligand is called the exhaustiveness. As exhaustiveness increases, the more reproducible the results tend to be. While the default value of exhaustiveness is 8, this notebook uses an exhaustiveness of 5 due to memory limitations.\n",
    "- The results of running the SMINA docking engine are stored as sdf files and can be located in the smina_out folder. However, due to the fact that the output files do not have a flag marking it as three dimensional, the sdf files must be read using SDMolSupplier and re-written using SDWriter to avoid excessive errors. The re-written sdf files can be found in the smina_out_2 folder. The names of each file follows the formula of `(ligand name)_pocket_(pocket number)_(name of folder).sdf` for the sdf files."
